# Command Update

There are checkpoint-chunks on the map to control.

the minimap draws a golden line around the next checkpoint-chunk to control.

- A command group can get a position to hold or be in auto battler mode.
- a command group attacks all units between the current position 
  and the target position.

Other mode is search for enemy to attack or conquer next checkpoint-chunk.
and the third mode is to fastly conquer checkpoints until you hit a defended one.

The next target is displayed as a red line from the middle of the 
command group.

The more checkpoints there are, the faster reinforcements can be spawned.

some chunks are Check-points , once only your units are in the
chunks, the checkpoint is yours
-  it stays yours until the enemy has all 4 chunks. and NO other units 
   are in the chunks.

-  There is only one spawn point. 

Number of checkpoints determines spawn speed of troops.
