# PartialWar V0.1 - The proof of concept

## Campaign-System
- round based 
- tile based 
- army based (create army with one click, add one group of units with another click)
- randomized 
- one army step per round
- join armies by moving them to the same tile
- if a tile contains a factory, you can buy units there
- once you have visited a tile, the tile belongs to you
  and generates resources for you (based on the tile type)
- resource tile, blocked tile, empty tile and factory tile 

## Battle-System
- your units come from the left
- enemy units come from the right
- the world is the same size as the screen
- you can spawn different types of units with your army points
  during the battle
- the goal is to kill all enemy units and loose as few as possible
